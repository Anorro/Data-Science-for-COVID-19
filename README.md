## Context
COVID-19 has infected more than 10,000 people in South Korea.  
KCDC (Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) announces the information of COVID-19 quickly and transparently.  
We make a structured dataset based on the report materials of KCDC and local governments.  
Also, we analyze and visualize the data using various data mining or visualization techniques.
